### Hello There!

Hi, my name is Vin√≠cius Filipe and i'm learning the fundamentals of web dev. I started programming at 2018 and fell in love with web development. I started working at DETRAN-PE in 2021, and i became a Full-Stack developer using .NET, JS and SQL Server. I'm currently learning ReactJS and NEXTJS and i look forward to be able to build new projects using the techs i love.
